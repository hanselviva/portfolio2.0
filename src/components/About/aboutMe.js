	biography:
		// "Hello, there! My name is Hansel. I grow up in a small island Southeast of the Philippines. Back then, we didn't have any technology that keeps us from playing outside. I was raised by my grandparents who were farmers at the time while my mother had to work as as laundrywoman to support us. Simply put, we couldn't afford any tech devices, appliances, or video game consoles. \n When I first touched a computer at age 11, I fell instantly love with it. The idea that a box can make a lot of difference in the world fascinated my young mind. My first PC was also my first built at age 19. That is why I wanted to be a developer. I want to contribute, in my own little way, to the technological progress of the human race.",

	education:
		"I graduated Valedictorian in High School despite having difficulties balancing work and school. I had to be a working student so I could pay my school fees and have food to eat. I then went to College and took BS in Civil Engineering with the scholarship I got being a valedictorian graduate. At my second year, I failed a subject and lost my scholarship. I joined competitions with cash prizes so I could have something to eat. Obviously, it wasn't enough to cover my tuition so I had to drop. However, it didn't stop me from learning things. After I moved in Oregon to be with my husband (then boyfriend), I took online courses which kept me occupied during my first year of moving including Google Analytics, Digital Marketing, and more about Search Engine Optimization.",
	career:
		"Four months ago, I didn't know what JavaScript is. Today, I can build React websites from scratch (thanks to Lambda School for their rigorous curriculum). That shows my willingness and hunger for learning. I am currently seeking position in any company that's open to accepting junior developers like me who are persevering and have passion for this field. ",
	interests_hobbies:
		"I love playing video games. My top played game on Steam has over 3,000 hours of playtime (probably not my proudest moment). I also love building PCs. The first ever PC I built was named Frankenstein due to it being literally a PC Frankenstein. Right now, Im rocking a gaming PC with GTX 1070 and a 2TB NVMe SSD. Sometimes, I watch Esports tournaments and scroll endlessly on social medias.",
