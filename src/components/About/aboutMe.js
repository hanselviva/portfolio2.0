		"Hello, there! My name is Hansel. I grew up in a small island Southeast of the Philippines. I have always been fascinated by computer and technology since I was a kid but growing up in a technology-starved environment, I didn't get the chance to explore this wonderful world of 1s and 0s until I moved here in the US. ",
		"I started Lambda School's Web Dev curriculum in January 2021 and since then, I have never felt so passionate about anything. I thrive on the critical-thinking and problem-solving skills this field requires to succeed. Over the last eight months, I always find myself developing web apps on top of Lambda Schools weekly project requirements. I hope to find a place where people value passion to learn and grow as a web developer and as a person.",
